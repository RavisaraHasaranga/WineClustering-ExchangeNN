# Wine Clustering and Exchange Rate Forecasting

This repository contains two distinct data analysis projects implemented in R:

## Wine Clustering

This project involves the analysis of a dataset of white wine varieties, focusing on their chemical properties and quality rankings. The goal is to perform partitioning clustering to understand the underlying structure of the data and potentially relate human quality testing to the chemical properties of the wine.

## Exchange Rate Forecasting

This project aims to predict the next dayâ€™s exchange rate of USD/EUR using a multilayer neural network (MLP-NN). The model is trained on historical exchange rate data and uses an autoregressive approach for forecasting.
